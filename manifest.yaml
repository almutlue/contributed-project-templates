- folder: omnibench-dataset
  name: Basic omnibenchmark dataset
  description: A simple R-based 4.0.4 renku project with a basic directory structure to add a dataset to an omnibenchmark project.
  allow_template_update: true
  immutable_template_files: [src/load_dataset.sh, src/workflow/define_workflow.sh]
  variables:
    description: short description added at the beginning of the readme file.

    study_nclusters: number of clusters (or cell-types) that were found in the study. 
    study_nbatches: the number of batches in the study (patient, experimental batch, technology, etc).
    study_note: any random notes about the dataset.
