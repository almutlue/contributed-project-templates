  variables:
    script_language: script language extension used to import/ create the data. E.g. "R", "py".
    tag: add here the tag of the benchmark. Each omnibenchmark has components that are linked together using a common tag. Use the same tag for all related benchmarks. Can be a list of tags (separated by space). No special characters. 
    study_link: if any, link to the original study (zenodo, GEO,...).

    study_nclusters: number of clusters (or cell-types) that were found in the study. 
    study_nbatches: the number of batches in the study (patient, experimental batch, technology, etc).
    study_note: any random notes about the dataset.
