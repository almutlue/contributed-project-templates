## Method template

This template will help you to add a method to an omnibenchmark project. For each method that you have, **one dedicated repository** has to be created from this template to upload the method on the renku system. 

The configuration of a method module is explained in details in the [Omnibenchmark documentation](https://omnibenchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/modules/02_method_module.html)
